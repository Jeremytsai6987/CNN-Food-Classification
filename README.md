## Introduction
The classification of food images is a challenging and relevant task in many applications, from dietary monitoring to restaurant and recipe recommendations. This project aims to build a robust CNN model capable of distinguishing between various food categories with high accuracy.

## Data Preparation
The dataset consists of numerous food images categorized into several classes. Each class represents a type of food. The preparation process involves:

- Sourcing the data from a publicly available food image dataset.
- Preprocessing steps such as resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset to improve model generalizability.
- Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

## Model Building
We employed a CNN architecture for this classification task due to its proven efficiency in handling image data. The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and fully connected layers for classification. The specific architecture details, including layer configurations and activation functions, will be outlined.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A detailed analysis of the results, including confusion matrices and class-wise performance, provides insight into the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion
The CNN model demonstrates promising results in food image classification, showcasing the potential of deep learning in visual data analysis. Future work may explore more complex architectures, larger datasets, and techniques to further improve accuracy and efficiency.
